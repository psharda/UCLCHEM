# User added bulk species
- Created fix for indexing issues cause by user added bulk species in the species file
- Makerates now stores user defined bulk species and their properties in separate list, and uses these values when auto-generating the defined species.
- This requires no new procedure by the user, this is handled internally. 
- Fixed typo that was overwriting this change
